# Idea Prioritization Kit for Founders

A simple, open-source framework (Notion & Markdown templates) to help you escape analysis paralysis and decide which startup idea to build next.

## 😫 The Problem: Analysis Paralysis

Are you a developer or founder with a long list of exciting ideas in Notion, Obsidian, or scattered in different notes? Do you spend more time wondering *what* to build than actually building?

This was my exact problem. The fear of choosing the "wrong" idea can be paralyzing. That's why I created this simple, structured kit – to solve my own problem.

## ✨ The Solution: A Simple 2-Step Framework

This kit provides two simple templates to bring clarity and consistency to your decision-making process.

1.  **✍️ Idea Capture Template:** A structured way to document every idea with the same key details – target audience, problem, solution, and monetization potential – making them easy to compare.
2.  **⚖️ Idea Rating Scorecard:** A set of 10 critical questions to objectively evaluate each idea based on market potential, personal fit, and feasibility.

## 🚀 How to Use This Kit

You have two options, choose whatever fits your workflow!
